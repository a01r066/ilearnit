# Social Sign-In Setup — Google & Apple

iLearnIt supports three authentication methods through Firebase Auth: **email + password** (already wired), **Google Sign-In**, and **Sign in with Apple**. Both work on the mobile app **and** the admin web portal — the Dart datasource branches on `kIsWeb` and switches between the native plugins (mobile) and Firebase's `signInWithPopup` (web). This doc covers the native + Firebase Console + Apple Developer + Google Cloud config you must do **once per environment** (dev + prod).

## Architecture summary

```
LoginPage / SignupPage / AdminLoginPage
        │  tap "Continue with Google" / "Continue with Apple"
        ▼
AuthNotifier.signInWithGoogle() / .signInWithApple()
        ▼
AuthRepository (network gate + token persistence)
        ▼
AuthRemoteDataSource — branches on kIsWeb:
   • Native Google:  GoogleSignIn().signIn() → GoogleAuthProvider.credential → signInWithCredential
   • Web Google:     FirebaseAuth.signInWithPopup(GoogleAuthProvider())
   • Native Apple:   SignInWithApple.getAppleIDCredential (nonce + sha256) → signInWithCredential
   • Web Apple:      FirebaseAuth.signInWithPopup(OAuthProvider("apple.com"))
        ▼
Firestore `users/{uid}` — upserted on first social sign-in (existing docs are preserved,
                                                            role defaults to 'student')
```

User cancellation is mapped to `Failure.auth(code: 'cancelled')` and the notifier swallows it, so the snackbar doesn't fire when the user just dismisses the picker. On web the matching error codes are `popup-closed-by-user`, `cancelled-popup-request`, and `user-cancelled`.

### Admin portal post-sign-in routing

When a brand-new user signs in via the admin login page for the first time, `users/{uid}` is created with `role: 'student'` (default). The admin router's redirect logic immediately sends them to `/apply` — they can fill in the instructor application form. After an admin approves, their role flips to `'instructor'`, and on the next sign-in (or live during the same session — Firestore stream keeps the router in sync) they land on the dashboard.

## 1. Firebase Console — enable both providers

For **both `iLearnIt-Dev` and `iLearnIt-Prod`** projects:

1. Firebase Console → **Authentication → Sign-in method**.
2. Enable **Google** — fill in the Project support email.
3. Enable **Apple** — leave the optional fields empty for the iOS-only flow.

## 2. Android — SHA fingerprints (Google Sign-In)

Google Sign-In on Android needs your app's signing fingerprints registered in Firebase, otherwise `GoogleSignIn().signIn()` returns `null` silently.

```bash
# debug fingerprint — for development on your machine
keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey \
  -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore \
  -storepass android -keypass android

# release fingerprint — for production builds
keytool -list -v -alias upload \
  -keystore android/app/upload-keystore.jks
```

In **Firebase Console → Project Settings → General → Your apps → Android app**:
- Add the **debug SHA-1** to the dev project.
- Add the **release SHA-1** *and* **SHA-256** to the prod project.
- After saving, re-download `google-services.json` and replace `android/app/src/dev/google-services.json` and `android/app/src/prod/google-services.json`.

No code changes — `flutter_flavorizr` already maps each flavor to its own `google-services.json`.

## 3. iOS — per-flavor Firebase config + Google Sign-In URL scheme

**No `GoogleService-Info.plist` is bundled in the iOS app.** Firebase is
initialized from Dart (`lib/bootstrap.dart`):

```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp(options: _firebaseOptions()); // DEFAULT app
```

`_firebaseOptions()` returns `firebase_options_dev.dart` or
`firebase_options_prod.dart` for the running flavor. A bundled plist used
to configure the default app natively for *both* flavors (pointing iOS
dev builds at production), so it was removed from the Runner target's
Copy Bundle Resources. Keep `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` out of
the target if you regenerate config with `flutterfire configure`.

Google Sign-In therefore gets its OAuth client from the same options
(`AuthRemoteDataSourceImpl`):

```dart
GoogleSignIn(
  clientId: !kIsWeb && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.iOS
      ? auth.app.options.iosClientId
      : null,
)
```

The callback URL scheme (the **reversed** iOS client id) is set per
flavor through Xcode build settings. `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>$(GOOGLE_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID)</string>
</array>
```

and each `ios/Flutter/{dev,prod}{Debug,Profile,Release}.xcconfig` defines
it (plain `Debug`/`Release` use the dev value):

```
GOOGLE_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID=com.googleusercontent.apps.<numbers>-<hash>
```

The value is `iosClientId` from the matching `firebase_options_*.dart`,
with the dotted parts reversed (`<id>.apps.googleusercontent.com` →
`com.googleusercontent.apps.<id>`). If you rotate an iOS OAuth client,
update both the options file and the three xcconfigs of that flavor.

## 4. iOS — Sign in with Apple capability

1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. Select the **Runner** target → **Signing & Capabilities** → **+ Capability** → **Sign in with Apple**.
3. Repeat for any per-flavor target (e.g. `Runner-Dev`, `Runner-Prod`) if you split targets.
4. Apple Developer Console → **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Identifiers → your App ID**.
5. Enable **Sign in with Apple** for the App ID. Save.
6. Regenerate provisioning profiles if Xcode prompts you.

If you ship to **TestFlight / App Store**, your bundle identifier must match the App ID you enabled "Sign in with Apple" on. The capability auto-adds an `aps-environment`-style entry to `Runner.entitlements` — let Xcode manage that file.

## 5. Android — Apple Sign-In (not enabled)

By design (see `LoginPage` & `SignupPage`), the Apple button only renders on iOS:

```dart
final showAppleButton = !kIsWeb && Platform.isIOS;
```

Android users sign in with Google or email. If you later need Apple on Android, you'll need to add a Service ID in Apple Developer Console, configure the redirect URL to `https://<your-firebase-app>.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`, and switch the Dart-side `Platform.isIOS` gate to allow Android — the existing `_remote.signInWithApple()` already uses `OAuthProvider("apple.com")` which works on both platforms.

## 6. Web admin portal — Google + Apple

The admin portal at `lib/main_admin.dart` exposes the **same** "Continue with Google / Continue with Apple" buttons. `AuthRemoteDataSource` branches on `kIsWeb` and uses `FirebaseAuth.signInWithPopup(...)` instead of the native plugins on web. There's no extra Dart code — just the Firebase + provider console setup below.

### 6.1 Firebase Console — authorized domains

Firebase Console → Authentication → **Settings → Authorized domains**. Add every origin that will serve the admin portal:

- `localhost` (always there by default — keeps `flutter run -d chrome` working)
- `<your-project>.web.app` and `<your-project>.firebaseapp.com` (Firebase Hosting default)
- `admin.ilearnit.app` or whatever custom subdomain you point at the Hosting target

If a domain is missing, `signInWithPopup` returns `auth/unauthorized-domain`.

### 6.2 Google — OAuth client for web

When you enabled Google in Step 1, Firebase auto-created a **Web client** OAuth credential in your linked Google Cloud project. To confirm and tweak it:

1. Google Cloud Console → **APIs & Services → Credentials** for the same project as Firebase.
2. Open the auto-generated "Web client (auto created by Google Service)" OAuth 2.0 client.
3. **Authorized JavaScript origins** — add `http://localhost:<port>`, `https://<project>.web.app`, and your custom domain.
4. **Authorized redirect URIs** — leave the default `https://<project>.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler` in place. Firebase routes the popup back through that handler.

No `client_id` meta tag is required in `web/index.html` because we delegate to Firebase's `signInWithPopup` — Firebase reads its own config from `firebase_options_*.dart`.

### 6.3 Apple — Service ID + return URL (web flow)

For Apple-on-web you need a **Services ID** in Apple Developer Console (the iOS App ID alone is not enough for the web popup flow).

1. Apple Developer Console → **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Identifiers → +** → **Services IDs**.
2. Identifier = `app.ilearnit.web` (or anything — this becomes your client_id for the web flow).
3. Enable **Sign In with Apple** on it → **Configure** → set:
   - Primary App ID = your iOS App ID
   - Domains and Subdomains = `<project>.firebaseapp.com`, plus any custom domains
   - Return URLs = `https://<project>.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`
4. Create a **Sign in with Apple private key** (separate from the APNs key): Apple Developer → Keys → + → enable "Sign in with Apple" → download the `.p8`.
5. Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method → **Apple → Edit**:
   - Services ID = the one from step 2.
   - OAuth code flow configuration:
     - Team ID
     - Key ID (from step 4)
     - Private key (paste the `.p8` contents)
6. Save. Within a minute the web Apple popup will work end-to-end.

### 6.4 Smoke test the web portal

```bash
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_admin.dart --dart-define=FLAVOR=dev
```

- Tap **Continue with Google** → standard Google account chooser opens → pick an account → portal lands on `/apply` (for a brand-new student) or `/` (for an existing instructor/admin).
- Tap **Continue with Apple** → Apple popup → sign in → same routing.
- Check `users/{uid}` in Firestore: `email`, `displayName`, `photoUrl` populated, `role: 'student'` by default.
- Cancel test: tap **Continue with Google**, close the popup window — no error snackbar should appear.

## 7. Verifying (mobile)

1. `flutter pub get` (pulls `google_sign_in`, `sign_in_with_apple`, `crypto`).
2. Run `flutter run --flavor dev`.
3. **Google**: tap "Continue with Google" → native picker → account chosen → land on Home, signed in.
4. **Apple** (iOS only): tap "Continue with Apple" → Face/Touch ID prompt → land on Home.
5. **Firestore**: a new `users/{uid}` doc should exist with `email`, `displayName`, `photoUrl`, `createdAt` populated.
6. **Cancel test**: tap "Continue with Google", then dismiss the sheet — no error snackbar should appear, you should stay on the Login screen.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `signIn()` returns `null` instantly on Android | SHA-1 missing in Firebase Console | Add debug+release SHA-1, re-download `google-services.json` |
| iOS Google picker shows "redirect URI mismatch" / returns silently | `GOOGLE_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` in the flavor's xcconfig doesn't match `iosClientId` | Fix the xcconfig (§3), clean build |
| iOS dev build writes to the prod project | A `GoogleService-Info.plist` was re-added to Copy Bundle Resources | Remove it from the Runner target (§3) |
| Apple button hangs after Face ID | Capability missing in App ID | Enable Sign in with Apple in Apple Developer Console + Xcode |
| First Apple login returns no name on second login | Apple only returns name on first authorization | We persist `displayName` to Firestore on first sign-in (see `_upsertSocialUser`) — re-test after deleting the Firebase user |
| `invalid-credential` from Apple | Stale nonce | Don't reuse credentials; each `signInWithApple()` generates a fresh nonce |
| Builds fail with `error: undefined symbol AuthenticationServices` | iOS deployment target too low | Set iOS deployment target ≥ 13.0 in `ios/Podfile` |
| Web `signInWithPopup` returns `auth/unauthorized-domain` | Origin not on the authorized domains list | Add it in Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains |
| Web Apple popup shows "Sign in with Apple isn't available" | Services ID missing or misconfigured | Step 6.3 — Services ID + return URL + private key on the Firebase Apple provider |
| Web Google popup shows `idpiframe_initialization_failed` | Browser blocking third-party cookies | Use a Chromium-based browser without third-party cookie blocking, or move to redirect flow (`signInWithRedirect`) |
| Web sign-in succeeds but admin portal lands on `/unauthorized` | `users/{uid}.isSuspended == true` | Check Firestore — unsuspend via the admin **Instructors** page or directly in the console |
